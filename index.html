			<p> Fairy Tales of Nature is a game by Fabo__HD. It's  a console based game in roleplay/rgp style with no graphics
			and just text, it includes a few routes which you can go thru in order to somewhat finish the game. It has
			a well developed lore how ever the game is very short , if we could encourge fabo to make a second version
			of this game it would be great!<br>
			Note from the developer*: <q> Thanks for all the undying support for this game </q></p>
			<p>Game can be also found in game jolt. Just <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/fairytales_of_nature/414663">click here</a></p>
